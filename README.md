# ThreeD Graphics Engine

## Overview
The 3D Engine is a Java-based graphics engine designed to facilitate the development of 3D applications and games. It provides a foundation for rendering and manipulating 3D scenes, supporting features like object loading, camera movement, and basic lighting.

## Features - V1
- **Object Loading:** Load 3D models from Wavefront (.obj) files, supporting only vertices.

- **Rendering:** Utilize a simple rendering pipeline to project and rasterize 3D triangles onto a 2D screen.

- **Lighting:** Implement basic flat shading with a directional light source, affecting the appearance of loaded objects.

- **Game Loop:** Employ a game loop to update and repaint the engine at a specified frames per second (FPS).

- **Backface Culling:** Optimize rendering performance by automatically discarding triangles that are not visible to the camera. Triangles with normals facing away from the camera are not drawn.
  
## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment.
3. Customize and extend the engine to suit your specific 3D graphics needs.
